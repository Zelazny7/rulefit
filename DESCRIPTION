Title: Create a Simple Combination of Rules From a Tree Ensemble
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eric E Graves
Maintainer: Eric E Graves <eric.graves@lexisnexisrisk.com>
Description: RuleFit uses an existing tree ensemble model as its input
    predictors. It first converts the ensemble into a series of rules
    corresponding to terminal nodes. It then fits a regularized regression model
    on these rules to produce a simpler model without sacrificing much, if any,
    performance.
